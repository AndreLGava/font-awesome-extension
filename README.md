# font-awesome-extension

Font Awesome Extension has changed the prefix from fa- to fae, it's because this was giving some problems with original Font Awesome icons project, and this is not the propose of this project. If you find any bug, or if you need an icon please create an issue, and I will try to resolve this as soon as possible. Thank you!
